RETRIEVAL ORIENTED DEEP FEATURE LEARNING WITH COMPLEMENTARY SUPERVISION MINING

ABSTRACT:

In this system, we suggest incorporating the SIFT function in a learning-based paradigm into the CNN function with a Siamese framework. The learning goal comprises of two types of loss, 
i.e. loss of resemblance and loss of loyalty. The first loss embeds the closest image-level neighbourhood structure with SIFT function in CNN feature learning, while the second loss imposes
that the CNN feature with the updated CNN model maintains that fidelity from the initial CNN model designed exclusively for classification. The produced CNN function inherits the property of 
the SIFT function after learning, which is well-oriented for retrieval of images.
